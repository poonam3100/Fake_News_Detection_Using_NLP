# Fake_News_Detection_Using_NLP

## Problem Statement:

The spread of fake news has become a significant challenge in todayâ€™s digital world. With the constant flow of news articles published daily, it is becoming harder to distinguish between credible and misleading information. This creates a need for systems that can automatically classify articles as true or fake, helping reduce misinformation and protect public trust.

## Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to develop a Semantic Classification model. You will be using Word2Vec method to extract the semantic relations from the text and develop a basic understanding of how to train supervised models to categorise text based on its meaning, rather than just syntax. You will explore how this technique is used in situations where understanding textual meaning plays a critical role in making accurate and efficient decisions.

In this assignment, you will develop a Semantic Classification model that uses the Word2Vec method to detect recurring patterns and themes in news articles. Using supervised learning models, the goal is to build a system that classifies news articles as either fake or true.
